# Development

## Checks and formatting

Use Python 3.10 or newer and Bash. Install the pinned tools in a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
export PATH="$PWD/.venv/bin:$PATH"
python3 scripts/check.py
```

Run `python3 scripts/check.py --fix` to format Python and shell and normalize text whitespace. The same checks run on pushes and pull requests. XML is checked for well-formedness; game schemas, XPath matches and gameplay require separate X4 validation. Blender scripts are parsed and linted without importing Blender.

Use UTF-8, LF, a final newline, spaces and no trailing whitespace. Indent code with four spaces and workflow YAML with two. Use descriptive names, uppercase shell variables, constant-first equality comparisons and explicit boolean checks. Ruff's E712 rule is disabled to retain explicit boolean comparisons. Keep shell free of prose comments. Keep only short, non-obvious constraints in code; put explanations here. XML continuation attributes may align with their opening attribute. Preserve XPath selectors, savegame identifiers and embedded game expressions when applying formatting.

## Installation and publishing helpers

`install.sh` and `publish.sh` both source `lib/find_x4.sh`. The library searches usual Steam roots and additional library folders. `X4_PATH`, `X_TOOLS_PATH`
and `PROTON_PATH` override discovery. Proton Experimental is preferred when found; otherwise the helper uses the last matching Proton directory it encounters.

Installation replaces the extension directory with a copy of `extension/`. Refresh it after edits; X4 enumerates real extension directories, so a symlink does not substitute for installation. Restart the game after installing or removing.

Publishing stages a separate copy inside the game's extensions directory. The repository keeps its readable extension id; `steam/workshop-id` holds the numeric Workshop id. The helper changes only the staged manifest, runs the interactive WorkshopTool and restores the manual installation after success. On Linux it runs WorkshopTool through Proton and maps paths through drive Z. A failed upload can leave the staged copy behind; rerun `./install.sh` to restore it.

## Release metadata

`content.xml` uses an integer version multiplied by 100 and an ISO release date. The date matches the corresponding released entry in `CHANGELOG.md`. Development changes belong under `Unreleased`; they do not advance the manifest's release version or date. An unreleased scaffold may retain its initial creation date until its first release. Keep existing extension ids stable.

## Implementation constraints

### extension/aiscripts/build.buildstorage.xml

Vanilla deliberately limits automatic construction-vessel requests to non-player build modules. Remove only that ownership gate from both places in build.buildstorage:

1. the branch that broadcasts a request once the build is waiting for a CV;
2. the short polling branch used while a build needs a CV but is still waiting for resources.

The recipient-side patch in order.build.find.task.xml makes the newly enabled player requests player-only. NPC stations and their existing cross-faction hiring behaviour remain untouched.

### extension/aiscripts/order.build.find.task.xml

A player build-storage request must only be accepted by a player-owned construction vessel that has a valid, blacklist-compliant gate route to the requesting build module.

This check is deliberately on the receiving side. build.buildstorage broadcasts to nearby ships with purpose.build, and vanilla NPC requests are allowed to cross faction boundaries. Filtering only player requests here preserves that NPC behaviour while preventing an NPC builder from being silently assigned to a player station without the normal hire/payment flow.
